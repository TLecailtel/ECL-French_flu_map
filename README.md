* Without needing to launch a local server, you can directly load *index.html* in Firefox.

### On any browser:
* If you have *node.js* installed, first install the *http-server* module with the command `npm install http-server -g`, then use the command `http-server` to launch a server, and use your browser to go to `localhost:8080/index.html`.
