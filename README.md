# ECL-French_flu_map
Map showing how the flu hit different French regions in 2014.

To be able to see the map, after you have downloaded this repository, you have at least 2 options:

### Only on Mozilla Firefox:
* Launch *index.html* directly on Firefox (without needing to start a local server).

### On any browser:
* If you have node.js installed, first instal the module *http-server* with the command `npm install http-server -g`, then use the command `http-server` to launch a server, and use your browser to go to `localhost:8080/index.html`.
